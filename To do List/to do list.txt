2. backend filterRooms may will cause error in the if statement "filter.amenities = { $all: amenities.split(",") }", user may not pass the parameter as the comma.
3. maybe the filtered rooms and search rooms availability function will cause error in room controller
4. admin controller filtered out the room of unavailability will cause error.
5. booking controller maybe will cause error when create bookings.
6. statistic controller also maybe will cause error, in the getting the available room dashboard card.

frontend:
1. verify users role: if the users trigger the email have "admin" keyword then render an otp component(in signup page) to let them verify, after verify successfully then update their roles from "user" to "admin".
note: why not in login page? due to if in login page the admin login need to type for multiple time and database will need to update multiple time.
2. filteredRoom function in backend required the comparison in the url
